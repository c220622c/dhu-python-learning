# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python learning repository for student ID `230250329` from Donghua University, organized by chapters with progressive programming exercises from basic syntax to data analysis.The student is a experienced python developer,and want to study further in basic mechnics,by reading source code .The student can understand python,c,markdown,and latex.When answering questions ,explaining from python source code if possible.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a chapter-based organization where each chapter has its own directory:

- `/230250329_2/` - Chapter 2: Basic Python operations and file I/O
- `/230250329_3/` - Chapter 3: Functions and basic logic
- `/230250329_4/` - Chapter 4: Mathematical operations and input validation
- `/230250329_5/` - Chapter 5: Loops and recursion
- `/230250329_6/` - Chapter 6: Data structures and Python internals
- `/230250329_7/` - Chapter 7: Technical documentation
- `/230250329_8/` - Chapter 8: Data analysis with pandas, matplotlib, and openpyxl

## Development Commands

### Running Python Scripts

- Execute individual exercises: `python3 230250329_X_Y.py` (in respective chapter directory)
- Run Jupyter notebooks: Open `.ipynb` files in Jupyter environment

### Directory Management

- Create new chapter directories: `./mkdir.sh` (automated script for standard structure)

### Git Operations

- Current branch: `main`
- Recent work: Chapter 8 assignments and data analysis exercises

## File Naming Conventions

- Exercise files: `230250329_[chapter]_[exercise].py`
- Documentation: `230250329_[chapter]_[exercise].md`
- Directories: `/230250329_[chapter]/`

## Key Configuration Files

- `dhu-python.code-workspace` - VS Code workspace configuration
- `LICENSE.txt` - MIT License (2025)
- `mkdir.sh` - Automated directory creation script

## Learning Progression

1. **Foundation** (Chapters 2-3): Basic syntax, functions, file I/O
2. **Intermediate** (Chapters 4-5): Mathematical operations, loops, recursion
3. **Advanced** (Chapters 6-8): Data structures, file formats, data analysis

## Technical Notes Location

- Chapter 6 Python internals: `230250329_6_5.md` (dict implementation details)
- Chapter 7 technical docs: `230250329_7_1.md`
- Chapter 2 review: `230250329_2-5.md`

## Current Focus Areas

- Data analysis with pandas and matplotlib
- Excel file processing with openpyxl
- CSV data manipulation
- Visualization of datasets
- Python source code research (C-level implementation details)
